Frequently Asked Questions:

-Where do I get JitBit? How do I use JitBit?-
Find it on your own. It's a free download. There are tutorials for it online too.


-What does 'due east' mean? Or 'due north' 'due southwest', et cetera?-
It means that the top of the compass in the minimap tab points perfectly in that direction,
i.e. 'due south' would mean the top of the compass says S, and the alignment is straight.

-What does iteration mean?-
When a macro finishes running it's instructions once, that is considered one iteration.
In the JitBit program, the default setting for number of iterations is 0, which is infinite.
Sometimes a helpfile will mention if that number needs to be changed to 1, for some scripts.

-What hotkey should I use in JitBit?-
CapsLock is good because it's not mapped to anything in the game client.
At some point though, you'll probably be holding shift to type lowercase, or exit JitBit.
Even better than CapsLock is the VolumeMute button on my keyboard. Not mapped to the game,
nor does it make typing difficult. Most keys are actually mapped somewhere in the Java cient,
which makes your botting more detectable; if you're concerned about such small details.
