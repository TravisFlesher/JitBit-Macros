Before you start:
Have tinderbox in first bag slot, rest logs
Change Jitbit settings to only run the script once

Notes:
//all clicks are randomized by position and time
//Pressing hotkey will drop a log and light it, after that you must manually move
before pressing hotkey again to make another fire, etc etc etc
