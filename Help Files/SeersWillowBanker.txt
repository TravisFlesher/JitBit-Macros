Before you start:
Equip a hatchet
Go to the willow trees northwest of seers bank, make sure you are just north
of the middle tree before starting
Position camera so that all 3 willow trees are visible, but no other trees are visible
camera mode set to manual
Sidebar must be on
Batch Progress Bar must be on

Notes:
//most clicks are randomized by time and position
//the bot stops when inventory is filled, displays a popup button, and will walk
back to the bank
//bank your logs manually and walk backto your starting position. then you can press the 
OK button from the popup,or restart the script
//there is a rare scenario if you reach 100 fatigue and full inventory at the same
time, you'll need to stop the script and start
again after banking/sleeping/ and going back to the willow trees
