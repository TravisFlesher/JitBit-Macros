Before you start:
Put shears in inventory slot 1, go to sheep
Change JitBit #of times to repeat to 1

Notes:
//made this one to make shearing way easier
//clicks are randomized by position and time
//i tried to make it more automatic but it wasn't working well, as the sheep are quite hyper.
//press the hotkey, then click a sheep, repeat
//you could put a different item in slot 1 and use this script for various purposes
