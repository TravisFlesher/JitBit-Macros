Before you start:
Withdraw staff and/or runes for falador teleport and telekinetic grab
Drag telekinetic grab to first position in the spellbook
Find entrance to crafting guild cow field, but do not enter it. Instead hug the fence 
(staying outside of it) and go as far west as you can, and position camera until you can
see the snape grasses on the peninsula.
Rotate your compass due 'northwest' and adjust zoom until the snape on the left is fully
visible but barely touching the left side of the game window.
sidebar must be enabled

Notes:
//after finding the annoying camera angle, change camera back to manual and
careful not to zoom in or out whilst running the script
//all clicks are randomized by time and position, to appear humanlike
//a pause button appears if you log out or become fatigued
