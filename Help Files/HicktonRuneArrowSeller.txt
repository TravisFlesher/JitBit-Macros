Before you start:
Have rune arrows in your bag
Have fog turned on
Zoom camera out all the way
Open Hickton's shop,  and click his rune arrows

Notes:
//zooming all the way out with fog on prevents colors from moving behind the search area
//the bot will sell 1 arrow, but only when the shop's stock is at 100.
//clicks randomized by position and time
