Before you start:
55 agility required for log bridge
Inventory contains 1 lockpick, bunch of mind and air runes
Save loadout to slot 4
Display inventory space must be on
Align camera due east and go to the chaos druid building just north of ardougne
after lockpicking the door, walk 2 tiles north
Zoom camera so that you can see just a couple of pixels of the westernmost wall
of the octagonal room that you're standing in


Notes:
//if you move away from default fighting position (2 tiles north after lockpicking door), go back to it
//no randomness added except a little when it collects loot (I didn't think more was needed)
//when no druids are present on screen, fighter will attempt to pickup loot
(if you're not killing fast enough, you may have to pause script to manually collect loot.
i found it helpful to press F1 to display the low-res scnalines on screen, which will 
momentarily prevent the bot from seeing druids and initiate the looting subroutine,
 then press F1 again to resume fighting)
//when it sees that you have a full inventory, the bot will stop fighting, walk to the bank,
 reset your loadout, walk back to the locked door, and display a confirmation button that
pauses the script until you press OK. which will give you time to open the door and
 get back into position.
