Before you start:
Bring pickaxe, brown apron, and sleeping bag to the crafting guild gold rocks
Zoom camera to about medium level, with all gold rocks in view

Notes:
//clicks are randomized by time
//pause the script when you have 20+ ores, go talk to master crafter
and exchange your ore for certifactes, walk back and resume botting
//may have to adjust the camera a bit, to find the sweet spot
