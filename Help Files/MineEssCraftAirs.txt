Before you start:
Setup your gear as follows - equip a pickaxe. first slot air talisman, second slot noted 
rune essence, third slot air runes.
Stand one tile to the N of the essence in barbarian village, zoom camera all the way in
and rotate compass due south
Display inventory space must be set to On

Notes:
//This bot will mine a full load of essence, go and craft them into airs, return, and repeat.
Quite complex, I know.
//All delays are randomized, most mouse clicks are randomized, except the position of
minimap movement, which must remain consistent to work.
//If logged out, a button will appear that will pause the bot until clicked. 
A button will also appear if you have sidebar enabled and reach 100 fatigue.
